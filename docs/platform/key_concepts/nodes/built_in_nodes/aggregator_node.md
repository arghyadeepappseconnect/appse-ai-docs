# Aggregator Node

The **Aggregator Node** is used to consolidate multiple incoming records into a single structured output.  
It enables flexible data reshaping, batching, and grouping before passing data to downstream nodes.

---

## When to Use Aggregator

Use this node when you need to:

- Combine multiple records into one payload  
- Batch data for API requests   
- Build custom output objects  

---

## Aggregation Modes Overview

The Aggregator Node currently supports one aggregation mode:

- **All Item Data**

---

## 1. All Item Data

This mode aggregates entire records into a single array wrapped inside a defined output field.

### All Item Data – Configuration Breakdown

| Configuration Field    | Description |
|------------------|------------|
| Output Field Name | Specifies the wrapper field that will contain the aggregated array. Use any custom name as per your requirement |
| Fields to Include | Determines how fields from each input record are included. The dropdown provides three options: `All Fields`, `Specified Fields`, and `All Fields Except` |
| Specified Fields  | Enter the exact fieldname(s) you want to include from input data packet, separated by commas. This option appears only when `Specified Fields` is selected for the Fields to Include field |
| Fields to Exclude | Enter the exact fieldname(s) you want to exclude from input data packet, separated by commas. This option appears only when `All Fields Except` is selected for the Fields to Include field |
